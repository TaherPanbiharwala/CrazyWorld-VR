# CrazyWorld-VR

This repository contains code for a Unity VR project that aims to explore artistic expressions in virtual reality, inspired by Picasso's unique art style. The project showcases a character brought to life with a distinctive limping effect, leveraging inverse kinematics and cosine functions to create an engaging and artistic virtual environment.

## Features

**Part 1: Setting up the Environment**
- Created a plane with different varieties of trees to give a forest-like feeling.
- Added a mirror in the middle to see your avatar.
- Applied materials to the trees, plane, and mirror.
- Added a skybox to the environment.

**Part 2: Basic Scripting**
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Allows for better head and hand tracking movements.
- **Limping Effect**: Used a cosine function to change the camera position after each step.
- **Speed Control**: Adjusted the speed to allow walking slow or fast depending on the user.
